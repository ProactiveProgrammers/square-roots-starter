# Reminder for ^^^:
# All commands executed in the setup block are done in a
# one-by-one fashion from the current working directory. This means
# that there is no history associated with running the commands and
# thus multiple commands must be run in a single chain.

# NOTE: This configuration does not have all of the standardly used
# checks for running the program through the various analysis tools.
